Final Project: Cryptography and Stenography
=============

#Introduction
This final project will consist of an implemented RSA cryptosystem and LSB stegosystem, to be done via Agile Programming methods and Test-Driven Development.

##Project Summary
The goal is not just to finish the project with some group of guys, but to work together in an organized and real world business-like fashion. The project itself will consist of more than just cryptosystem and stegosystem creation. We will also be testing for the weaknesses of the systems by working attacks on them. 

The plan for developing these RSA and LSB systems is to use scrums, brief 4-times-a-week meetings, and an Agile Programming inspired website called Taiga, as well as Test-Driven Development with testing code made from scratch. All of the project will be kept tidy and updated in real-time on the TAMU Github. 

##Implementation Details
The project will be done, as far as we know at this point, in C++. This means the entire RSA, LSB, and Testing software segments will be done from start to finish in C++ code. As noted previously, Taiga will be the primary means for staying organized and Github will be the primary means for keeping the project together. The current plan is to split into two teams, one side for RSA cryptography and one side for LSB steganography.
